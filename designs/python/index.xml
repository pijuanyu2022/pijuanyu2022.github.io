      <description>The purpose of this project is to do the navigation, SLAM, and track an apriltag for an omnidirectional robot by using one T265 tracking camera (above). This camera will be undistorted to get a disparity map, 3D point clouds, and laser scan. Then I will use this camera to get a 2D map and avoid the obstacle.

      <description>In this robot simulation, a new object will be assembled by two UR5 arms with RG2 grippers. These two UR5 arms will be controlled by the Moveit!, remote API, python3, and ROS. The whole simulation will be done in the CoppeliaSim cross-platform. The docker approach will be helpful to make sure that everyone will run the code in the same environment with different machines and operating systems.

      <description>In this project, the dynamic will be simulated through python. A jack will be animated in a box. The box will move to the upper right. And the jack will go into free fall and then impact with the bottom of the box. After that, the jack will bounce up and rotate. And then it will impact the box again. Due to the impact of the jack, the box will also rotate and go down a little bit.</description>
