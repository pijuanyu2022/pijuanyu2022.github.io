I am a master's student at Northwestern University, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and specializing in robotics and control. At present, I am doing some fascinating projects in the CRB lab at Northwestern University.

I was born in HuangShi City in China and have studied in the United States for around 3 years. I used to live in Florida for the first two years and right now I am living in Illinois. These overseas study experiences allowed me to know various people from different backgrounds.

## Education

I studied as an undergraduate at first at Wuhan Institute of Technology in 2016 and 2017. I had a wonderful time with my five roommates. I had a part-time job in a restaurant. And I used this money to enroll in a ukulele class.

In 2018, I transferred to the Florida Institute of Technology after taking part in a Chinese-foreign cooperative education program. During these two years, I went to Universal Studios in Orlando and the Yellowstone National Park with my friends. In addition to travel, I did a very interesting capstone project with 12 students about how to design and build a electrical formula car.

After graduating from the Florida Institute of Technology, I continue to pursue a master degree at Northwestern University. Instead of learning everything about mechanical engineering, I focused on robotics and control. And I did plenty of creative and fascinating projects. 

Now I am living in Evanston and doing some research about navigation with the help of computer vision.

## Hobbies

Apart from working, I love traveling, skiing, cycling, and playing video games. I am also interested in learning a foreign language except for English and Mandarin. I used to learn French when I was at the Florida Institute of Technology. At present, I am learning Japnese from some tutorials. If you are also interested in it, please contact me.
