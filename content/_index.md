Hey,

I'm Pijuan Yu, a master's student at Northwestern University, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and specializing in robotics and control.

I had done various projects about mechanical design, robot control, computer vision, and mechatronics. I also have a minor degree in Engineering Management. I used to study in China and now I am living in the US. These interesting experiences broaden my horizon and open my mind.
